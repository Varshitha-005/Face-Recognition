# Face-Recognition
This project uses OpenCV and DeepFace to detect and recognize faces in real-time from a webcam feed. Recognized individuals are announced via text-to-speech using the pyttsx3 library. Unknown faces are labeled and announced accordingly. The system compares live face input with a pre-stored face database and provides real-time audio feedback.
